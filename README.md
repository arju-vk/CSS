CSS: Stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

Key Concepts in CSS:

<h4>Selectors:</h4> Used to target specific HTML elements to apply styles. Examples include element selectors (e.g., p), class selectors (e.g., .my-class), and ID selectors (e.g., #my-id).

<h4>Properties and Values:</h4> CSS rules consist of properties (e.g., color, font-size) and their corresponding values (e.g., blue, 16px).

<h4>Cascading:</h4> The "cascading" in CSS refers to how style rules are applied and resolved when multiple rules might conflict. Rules from different sources (browser defaults, user styles, author styles) are prioritized based on specificity, inheritance, and order.

<h4>Box Model:</h4> Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box, with properties for content, padding, border, and margin that can be controlled with CSS.

<h4>Layout Techniques:</h4> CSS offers various techniques for arranging elements on a page, including Flexbox and Grid, which provide powerful tools for creating responsive and complex layouts.
